# BITEhack2022 - 24 hour competition

During 24h competition our idea were to create the rescuer supporting robot. 
The robot should automatically move around the room, avoiding obstacles that is smoky as a result of a fire. 
After hearing the sound signal (clap) from the victim, the robot should send an acoustic and visual SOS signal using the walrus alphabet.

The project was created using ESP and Arduino UNO microcontrollers and also necessary sensors. Everything was powered by 4 AA batteries and a power bank.
